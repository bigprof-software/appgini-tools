# appgini-tools
Additional scripts and tools I built to use with AppGini

* [Authentication logging](authentication-logging.md) - Add the ability to track who has logged on (or tried to) by logging access to a table
* [Reporting](report.php) - Add simple reporting to your AppGini project.
* [Google Authenticator](google-authenticator.md) support
* [Password Hashing](password-hashing.md) - remove the insecure MD5 hashing in AppGini generated applications
